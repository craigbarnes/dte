@h1 COMMAND SYNTAX

*dterc* is the language used in *dte*(1) *r*untime *c*onfiguration files
and also in the command mode used from within the editor.

The syntax of the language is quite similar to shell, but much simpler.

Commands are separated either by a newline or ";" character. To make a
command span multiple lines in an rc file, escape the newline (put
"\\" at the end of the line).

Rc files can contain comments at the start of a line. Comments begin
with a "#" character and can be indented, but they can't be put on the
same line as a command.

Commands can contain environment variables. Variables always expand into
a single argument even if they contain whitespace. Variables inside
single or double quotes are NOT expanded. This makes it possible to bind
keys to commands that contain variables (inside single or double
quotes), which will be expanded just before the command is executed.

Example:
	alias x "run chmod 755 $FILE"

$FILE is expanded when the alias x is executed. The command works even
if $FILE contains whitespace.

@h2 Special variables

These variables are always defined and override environment variables of
the same name.

*$FILE*
	The filename of the current buffer (or an empty string if unsaved).
*$WORD*
	The selected text or the word under the cursor.

@h2 Single quoted strings

Can't contain single quotes or escaped characters.

@h2 Double quoted strings

May contain the following escapes:

@li *\\a \\b \\t \\n \\v \\f \\r \\\\*
Control characters (same as in C)
@li *\\x*0a
Hexadecimal byte value 0x0a. Note that 0x00 is not supported because
strings are NUL-terminated.
@li *\\u*20ac
Four hex digit unicode code point U+20AC.
@li *\\U*000020ac
Eight hex digit unicode code point U+20AC.

@h1 COMMANDS

*alias* <`name`> <`command`>
	Create an alias `name` for `command`.

	Example:
		alias read "pass-through cat"

	Now you can run "read file.txt" to insert file.txt into the current
	buffer.

*bind* <`key`> [`command`]
	Bind `command` to `key`. If no `command` is given then any existing
	binding for `key` is removed.

	Keys:
		insert delete home end pgup pgdown left right up down F1
		F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 F11 F12 enter tab space (or sp)

	Modifiers:
		Ctrl: *C-X* or *^X*

		Meta/Alt: *M-X*

		Shift: *S-left*

	Key chains are supported. For example "^X c" (press *^X* and then *c*).
	Keys are separated by spaces.

*bof*
	Move to beginning of file.

*bol*
	Move to beginning of line.

*bolsf*
	Incrementally move cursor to beginning of *l*ine, then beginning
	of *s*creen, then beginning of *f*ile.

*case* [*-lu*]
	Change text case. Default is to change lower case to upper and
	vice versa.

	*-l* lower case

	*-u* upper case

*cd* <`directory`>
	Change directory. Updates $PWD and $OLDPWD. "*cd -*" changes to
	previous directory ($OLDPWD).

*center-view*
	Center view to cursor.

*clear*
	Clear current line.

*close* [*-fqw*]
	Close file.

	*-f* close file even if it hasn't been saved after last modification

	*-q* quit if closing the last open file

	*-w* close parent window if closing its last contained file

*command* [`text`]
	Enter command line. If `text` is given then it is written to the
	command line (see the default binding *^L* why this is useful).

*compile* [*-1ps*] <`errorfmt`> <`command`> [`parameters`]...
	Run external `command` and collect error messages. This can be
	used to run *make*(1) and *grep*(1).

	*-1* read error messages from stdout instead of stderr

	*-p* display "Press any key to continue" prompt

	*-s* silent. both stderr and stdout are redirected to /dev/null

	See also *errorfmt* and *msg* commands.

*copy*
	Copy current line or selection.

*cut*
	Cut current line or selection.

*delete*
	Delete character or selection.

*delete-eol* [*-n*]
	Delete to end of line.

	*-n* delete newline if cursor is at end of line

*delete-word* [*-s*]
	Delete word after cursor.

	*-s* be more "aggressive"

*down*
	Move cursor down.

*eof*
	Move cursor to end of file.

*eol*
	Move cursor to end of line.

*eolsf*
	Incrementally move cursor to end of *l*ine, then end of
	*s*creen, then end of *f*ile.

*erase*
	Erase character before cursor.

*erase-bol*
	Erase to beginning of line.

*erase-word* [*-s*]
	Erase word before cursor.

	*-s* be more "aggressive"

*errorfmt* [*-i*] <`compiler`> <`regexp`> [*file*|*line*|*column*|*message*]...

	*-i* ignore this error

	See *compile* and *msg* commands for more information.

*filter* <`command`> [`parameter`]...
	Filter selected text or whole file through external `command`.

	Example: filter sort -r

*format-paragraph* [`width`]
	Format the current selection or paragraph under the cursor. If
	paragraph `width` is not given then the *text-width* option is
	used.

	This command merges the selection into one paragraph. To format
	multiple paragraphs use the external *fmt*(1) program with the
	*filter* command, e.g. *filter fmt -w 60*.

*ft* <`filetype`> <`extensions`>...
	Associate filename `extensions` with `filetype`.

*ft* *-c* <`filetype`> <`regexp`>...
	Detect `filetype` by matching `regexp` against first line of
	file.

*ft* *-f* <`filetype`> <`regexp`>...
	Detect filetype by matching the regexp against filename.

*ft* *-i* <`filetype`> <`interpreters`>...
	Associate `interpreters` with `filetype`. Interpreters are parsed
	from the *#!* line in many scripts.

*git-open*
	Interactive file opener. Lists all files in GIT repository.

	Same keys work as in command mode, but with these changes:

	@li up
	Move up in file list.
	@li down
	Move down in file list.
	@li enter
	Open file.
	@li ^O
	Open file but don't close git-open.
	@li M-e
	Go to end of file list.
	@li M-t
	Go to top of file list.

*hi* <`name`> [`fg-color` [`bg-color`]] [`attribute`]...
	Set highlight color.

	Colors:
		keep (-2) default (-1) black (0) red green yellow blue
		magenta cyan gray darkgray lightred lightgreen lightyellow
		lightblue lightmagenta lightcyan white

	Color can be given as a numeric value too (-2..255).

	Colors 16-255 are supported by modern *xterm*(1) compatible terminal
	emulators. There's a 6x6x6 color cube at indexes 16..231. For
	these colors it is easiest to use the R/G/B syntax where R, G
	and B are values between 0 and 5.

	Indexes 232..255 contain 24 grayscale values that can be used
	to specify grayscale value more accurately than using the R/G/B
	syntax.

	Attributes:
		bold lowintensity italic underline blink reverse invisible keep

	The color and attribute value "keep" is useful in selected text
	to keep `fg-color` and attributes and change only `bg-color`.

	NOTE: Because "keep" is both a color and an attribute you need to
	specify both `fg-color` and `bg-color` if you want to set the "keep"
	`attribute`.

	If you omit any color it is set to default (-1).

	Unset fg/bg colors are inherited from highlight color "default".
	If you don't set fg/bg for the highlight color "default" then
	terminal's default fg/bg is used.

*include* [*-b*] <`file`>
	Read commands from `file`.

	*-b* read built-in `file` instead of reading from the filesystem

*insert* [*-km*] <`text`>
	Insert `text` into the buffer.

	*-k* insert one character at a time as if it has been typed

	*-m* move after inserted text

*insert-special*
	Insert special character.

	Insert control character,
	type decimal value of byte to insert or press
	*o* to insert octal byte value,
	*x* to insert hexadecimal byte value or
	*u* to insert hexadecimal unicode value.

	be given for every option.

	There are three kinds of options.

	@li 1. Global options

	@li 2. Local options
		These are file specific options. Each open file has its
		own copies of the option values.

	@li 3. Options that have both global and local values
		Global value is just a default local value for opened
		files and never used for anything else. Changing global
		value does not affect any already opened files.

		By default *set* changes both global and local values.

		*-g* change only global option value

		*-l* change only local option value of current file

	In configuration files only global options can be set (no need
	to specify the -g flag).

	To change option for specific filetypes and filenames use the
	*option* command.

*setenv* <`name`> <`value`>
	Set environment variable.

*shift* <`count`>
	Shift current or selected lines by `count` indentation levels.
	Count is usually -1 (decrease indent) or 1 (increase indent).

	To specify a negative number, it's necessary to first disable
	option parsing with "--", e.g. "shift -- -1".

*suspend*
	Suspend program.

*tag* [*-r*] [`tag`]
	Save current location to stack and go to the location of `tag`.
	Requires tags file generated by Exuberant Ctags. If no `tag` is
	given then word under cursor is used as a tag instead.

	*-r* return back to previous location

	Tag files are searched from current working directory and its
	parent directories.

	See also *msg* command.

*toggle* [*-gv*] <`option`> [`values`]...
	Toggle `option`. If list of `values` is not given then the option
	must be either boolean or enum.

	*-g* toggle global option instead of local

	*-v* display new value

	If `option` has both local and global value then local is toggled
	unless -g is given.

*undo*
	Undo latest change.

*unselect*
	Unselect.

*up*
	Move cursor up.

*view* <`N`|*last*>
	Display `N`th or last open file.

*wclose* [*-f*]
	Close window.

	*-f* close even if there are unsaved files in the window

*wflip*
	Change from vertical layout to horizontal and vice versa.

*wnext*
	Next window.

*word-bwd* [*-s*]
	Move cursor backward one word.

	*-s* skip special characters

*word-fwd* [*-s*]
	Move cursor forward one word.

	*-s* skip special characters

*wprev*
	Previous window.

*wresize* [*-hv*] [`N`|*+*`N`|*-- -*`N`]
	If no parameter given, equalize window sizes in current frame.

	*-h* resize horizontally

	*-v* resize vertically

	`N` Set size of current window to `N` characters.

	*+*`N` Increase size of current window by `N` characters.

	*-*`N` Decrease size of current window by `N` characters
	(prefixed with *--* to stop option parsing).

*wsplit* [*-bhr*] [`file`]...
	Like *open* but at first splits current window vertically.

	*-b* Add new window before current instead of after.

	*-h* Split horizontally instead of vertically.

	*-r* Split root instead of current window.

*wswap*
	Swap positions of this and next frame.

@h1 OPTIONS

Options can be changed using the *set* command. Enumerated option values
can also be *toggle*d. To see which options are enumerated type "toggle "
on command line and press tab. You can also use the *option* command
to set filetype/filename specific options.

@h2 Local and global options

Global values of these options serve as default values for local
(per-file) options.

*auto-indent* [true]
	Automatically insert indentation when pressing enter.
	Indentation is copied from previous non-empty line. If also the
	*indent-regex* local option is set then indentation is
	automatically increased if the regular expression matches
	current line.

*detect-indent* [""]
	Comma-separated list of indent widths (1-8) to detect
	automatically when file is opened. Set to "" to disable. Tab
	indentation is detected if the value is not "". Adjusts
	following options if indentation style is detected:
	*emulate-tab*, *expand-tab*, *indent-width*.

	Example:
		set detect-indent 2,3,4,8

*emulate-tab* [false]
	Make *delete*, *erase* and moving *left* and *right* inside
	indentation feel as if there were tabs instead of spaces.

*expand-tab* [false]
	Convert tab to spaces on insert.

*file-history* [true]
	Save line and column for each file to $DTE_HOME/file-history.

*indent-width* [8]
	Size of indentation in spaces.

*syntax* [true]
	Use syntax highlighting.

*tab-width* [8]
	Width of tab. Recommended value is 8. If you use other
	indentation size than 8 you should use spaces to indent.

*text-width* [72]
	Preferred with of text. Used as default value for
	*format-paragraph*.

*ws-error* [special]
	Comma-separated list of flags that describe which whitespace
	errors should be highlighted. Set to "" to disable.

	*auto-indent*
		If the *expand-tab* option is enabled then this is the
		same as "tab-after-indent,tab-indent". Otherwise it's
		the same as "space-indent".

	*space-align*
		Highlight spaces used for alignment after tab
		indents as errors.

	*space-indent*
		Highlight space indents as errors. Note that this
		still allows using less than *tab-width* spaces at the
		end of indentation for alignment.

	*tab-after-indent*
		Highlight tabs used anywhere other than indentation as
		errors.

	*tab-indent*
		Highlight tabs in indentation as errors. If you set this
		you most likely want to set "tab-after-indent" too.

	*special*
		Display all characters that look like regular space as
		errors. One of these characters is no-break space
		(U+00A0), which is often accidentally typed (AltGr+space
		in some keyboard layouts).

	*trailing*
		Highlight trailing whitespace characters at the end of
		lines as errors.

@h2 Local only options

*brace-indent* [false]
	Scan for "{" and "}" characters when calculating indentation size.
	Depends on the *auto-indent* option.

*filetype* [none]
	Type of file. Value must be previously registered using the *ft*
	command.

*indent-regex* [""]
	If this regular expression matches current line when enter is
	pressed and *auto-indent* is true then indentation is increased.
	Set to "" to disable.

@h2 Global only options

*case-sensitive-search* [true]
	false
		Search is case-insensitive.
	true
		Search is case-sensitive.
	auto
		If search string contains a uppercase letter search is
		case-sensitive, otherwise it is case-insensitive.

*display-special* [false]
	Display special characters.

*esc-timeout* [100] 0...2000
	When single escape is read from the terminal dte waits some
	time before treating the escape as a single keypress. The
	timeout value is in milliseconds.

	Too long timeout makes escape key feel slow and too small
	timeout can cause escape sequences of for example arrow keys to
	be split and treated as multiple key presses.

*lock-files* [true]
	Lock files using $DTE_HOME/file-locks. Only protects from your
	own mistakes (two processes editing same file).

*newline* [unix]
	Whether to use LF (`unix`) or CRLF (`dos`) line-endings. This is
	just a default value for new files.

*scroll-margin* [0]
	Minimum number of lines to keep visible before and after cursor.

*show-line-numbers* [false]
	Show line numbers.

*statusline-left* [" %f%s%m%r%s%M"]
	Format string for the left aligned part of status line.

	@li %f
	Filename.

	@li %m
	"\*" if file is has been modified since last save.

	@li %r
	"RO" if file is read-only.

	@li %y
	Cursor row.

	@li %Y
	Total rows in file.

	@li %x
	Cursor display column.

	@li %X
	Cursor column as characters. If it differs from cursor
	display column it is show too (e.g. "2-9").

	@li %p
	Position in percentage.

	@li %E
	File encoding.

	@li %M
	Miscellaneous status information.

	@li %n
	Line-ending (LF or CRLF).

	@li %s
	Add separator.

	@li %t
	File type.

	@li %u
	Hexadecimal unicode value value of character under cursor.

	@li %%
	Literal %.

*statusline-right* [" %y,%X   %u   %E %n %t   %p "]
	Format string for the right aligned part of status line.

*tab-bar* [horizontal]
	hidden
		Hide tab bar.
	horizontal
		Show tab bar on top.
	vertical
		Show tab bar on left if there's enough space, hide otherwise.
	auto
		Show tab bar on left if there's enough space, on top otherwise.

*tab-bar-max-components* [0]
	Maximum number of path components displayed in vertical tab bar.
	Set to 0 to disable.

*tab-bar-width* [25]
