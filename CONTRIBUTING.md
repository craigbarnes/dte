Pull Requests
-------------

* Create a separate feature branch and pull request for each issue.
* Avoid mixing unrelated commits in the same pull request.
* Include as few self-contained commits as necessary.
* Use rebase to avoid fix-up commits and merge commits.

Bug Reports
-----------

* Check for existing bug reports before opening a new one.
* Include error messages and test cases as Markdown [code blocks].
* Avoid linking to external paste services.
* Make test cases as minimal as possible.

Commit Messages
---------------

* Hard wrap lines at 72 columns.
* Use proper sentence case and punctuation.
* Don't use GitHub-specific references (e.g. "fixes issue #9").
* The first line should be a single-sentence summary.
* If writing more than just a summary, add a blank line followed by
  any number of wrapped paragraphs.

Coding Style
------------

* Above all else, be consistent with the existing code.
