# This config contains usage examples for dte's built-in scripts (i.e.
# those listed by `dte -B | grep ^script/`) and can be included in a
# user's `rc` file with the command `include -b extra`.

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# NOTE: built-in scripts are currently undocumented and thus may be
# changed in backwards incompatible ways at any time. They're also
# only usable (via `exec -b`, at least) on platforms that implement
# memfd_create(2), which is currently just Linux and FreeBSD.
