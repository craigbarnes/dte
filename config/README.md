dte built-in configs
====================

The files in this directory are embedded into the `dte` program binary
at compile-time. The `rc` file is loaded by default when the editor
starts.

When `dte` is installed, the full list of embedded files can be printed
using `dte -B` and the contents of any embedded file can be printed
using, for example, `dte -b binding/default`.

For more information, see <https://craigbarnes.gitlab.io/dte/dterc.html>.
