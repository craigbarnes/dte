Frequently (never actually) Asked Questions
-------------------------------------------

Q: Why the weird default key bindings?

Because I'm a former vim user I made the default key bindings similar to
vi (^Y (yy) is copy, ^D (dd) is cut and so on). Of course dte is
modeless unlike vi. That makes them feel very different.


Q: Is the syntax highlighter same used in JOE (Joe's Own Editor)?

The idea did came from JOE, but I didn't use the code because I wanted
to use different syntax (the same used in other dte rc files). Also
colors are hard coded into JOE's syntax highlighting files, which is a
major problem. To change the colors you'd have to edit all syntax files.
So I decided to write my own.


Q: Why the custom build system and not Autotools?

Because Autotools is absolutely horrible. configure is 10000 (yes, ten
thousand) line shell script which generates tons of files. In contrast
the makefiles and scripts in dte are only about 350 lines total.
