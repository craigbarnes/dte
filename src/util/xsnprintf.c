/*
 * ISO C doesn't require vsnprintf(3) to set errno on failure, but
 * POSIX does:
 *
 * "If an output error was encountered, these functions shall return
 * a negative value and set errno to indicate the error."
 *
 * The mandated errors of particular interest are:
 *
 * - [EOVERFLOW] The value of n is greater than INT_MAX
 * - [EOVERFLOW] The value to be returned is greater than INT_MAX
 *
 * ISO C11 states:
 *
 * "The vsnprintf function returns the number of characters that would
 * have been written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the
 * terminating null character, or a negative value if an encoding error
 * occurred. Thus, the null-terminated output has been completely
 * written if and only if the returned value is nonnegative and less
 * than n."
